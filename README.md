# Nutritional Content of Cereals

## Project Overview

This project is primarily focused on the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of cereals' nutritional content and its correlation with manufacturers' ratings. We delve into an extensive dataset of 80 different cereal flakes produced by 7 manufacturers. The project aims to uncover underlying patterns and insights from nutritional data like calories, protein, fat, sodium, and more, and how these factors influence the ratings assigned to each manufacturer's cereals. The EDA approach allows us to visualize complex relationships within the data, offering a comprehensive understanding of the factors that contribute to the cereals' overall ratings.

## Installation

To run the analysis, you need Python and the following libraries:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

Install these packages using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## Dataset

The dataset (`cereal.csv`) includes the following fields:
- Name: Name of cereal 
- Manufacturer: Represented by initials (e.g., A, G, K)
- Nutritional contents: calories, protein, fat, sodium, fiber, carbohydrates, sugars, potassium, vitamins
- Others: shelf display, weight, rating

## Methodology

Our analysis involves:
- Data Pre-processing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
- Data Visualization: Using bar plots, regression plots, scatter plots, and swarm plots to visualize relationships.

## Results

Key findings include:
- Certain manufacturers like German Mills and Nabisco show extremes in nutritional content values.
- Relationships between nutritional contents (like calories, protein, fat) and cereal ratings.
- Nabisco products have the highest ratings.

## Usage

To replicate our analysis:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook (`DV Project.ipynb`).
